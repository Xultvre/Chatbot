Hello
Hi
Hey
How are you
What are you doing
What's up
Tell me a joke
I'm bored
I feel sad
I'm depressed
I don't know what to do
I need help
Life feels pointless
I feel hopeless
I feel like killing myself
kms
I'm scared
Nobody understands me
I feel overwhelmed
I'm happy today
I got a new job
I'm in love
What is your name
Can you help me
Why is life so hard
Do you have feelings
You are so smart
Do you have emotions
Goodbye
See you later
I feel anxious
I'm stressed out
I feel lost
I'm lonely
I'm worthless
Nobody cares about me
I'm exhausted
I'm frustrated
I'm angry
Thank you
I love you
I am fine
